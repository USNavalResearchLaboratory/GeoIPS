TODO:

Clean up init and clean systems
The initialization is pretty opaque and likely very difficult to figure out
Note that there are several variables in there that should likely be turned into functions
Additionally, it would be nice to move much of the init stuff to the top level

When building multiple times, multiple entries for each package will show up in docs
Need to fix this.  Simply deleting the geoalgs_modules.txt file will not work, though.
Will need to figure out how to dynamically figure out what is already there.
May want to set up a function that looks for module level .rst files then adds them all to
geoalgs_modules.txt each time make is called.

Note that it is difficult to deal with extra files that need to be cleaned.
For example, config.f90 and the init files.  Should work on this.

Currently the module level .rst files are not getting cleaned from docs/source properly
Should fix this, but it is not breaking anything

There are a lot of things that are not currently working when make is called multiple times
without a make clean in between.  Really need to fix these issues:
    imports in __init__ files
    module level documentation
    adding modules to geoalgs_modules.txt
Take a look at how this is handled in fires/module.mk.  This may work.
May want to make implicit rules for these situations.

Cleaning the fires module needs to be handled better.  Currently this is hardwired in
the top level make file.  Note that this was done to avoid creating a symlink which is
supposed to be avoided in makefiles.  Additionally, make does not appear to recognize
symlinks as completed targets, even when they exist.
